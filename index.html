        i became interested in native plants last year when i heard a radio show about how they're so important because they attract native pollinators and pollinators make the world go round. this summer my mom and i planted a tree in our backyard which made me want to learn more about indigenous plants. for this project i sought out to learn about plants native to where i live in merrick long island/sewanhackey and to compile that knowledge in a food-chain style to create a non-linear narrative. i prioritize native plants because of their ecological importance. i also prioritize plants that i see regularly as a springboard for understanding the complex ecosystem that i inhabit. 
        
      the work aims to simulate the process of outdoor exploration by presenting the viewer with glimpses of the environment. the viewer chooses which food chain to pursue. i include personal sentiments to replicate the internal process of reflecting in nature and create a sense of intimacy for the viewer to engage with.
    
        i also document my newfound knowledge about the fields of botany and horticulture. this project is a result of working knowledge and is not the end-all be all source of information on botany, horticulture, or nativity.

        i do not depict human interference such as garbage, climate change, domesticated animals, etc.
    
        since starting this project, ive come across a number of silimar websites including:
            - https://tree-map.nycgovparks.org/tree-map/species/71738
            - https://bayardcutting.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=99a4d4c4e643488ca24131c8eb61597b
